# Product Cards

### Description:
This was an exercise in using "FlexBox" to alter the layout of a webpage. I was also challenged in the task of positioning the "Sold Out" image over just one of the product cards even when they moved positions. I was given certain styling, and position requirements which I followed, but was also given some creative freedom to explore CSS a bit on my own. Please excuse the ugly colors!
